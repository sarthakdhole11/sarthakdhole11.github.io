        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>I am steered by a profound curiosity that spans physics, biology, and philosophy, each adding unique perspectives to my understanding of the world. Psychoanalysis and Linguistics intrigue me because of their ties to Philosophy while Economics captivates me as it gives me a chance to sharpen my decision-making skills. My passion for Ethology stems from the ability to study animal behavior free from stereotypes, revealing patterns that inform broader social and economic insights. I seek to bridge diverse knowledge areas, aiming to contribute meaningfully to both scientific progress and societal growth through collaborative inquiry and innovative exploration.</p>
